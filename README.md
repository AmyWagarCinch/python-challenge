# python-challenge

PyBank

In this challenge, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company to calculate each of the following: the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period and the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. My final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.


PyPoll



In this challenge, I am to help a fictional small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. The dataset provided is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. My final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
